    About Me Hello, I'm Lance Minney. With over 15 years of experience in sales
    roles across various major and independent companies, I have developed a
    keen ability to understand and meet client needs effectively. My extensive
    background in sales is complemented by over 20 years in audio production and
    engineering, where I have not only produced and engineered music but also
    engaged in the construction and manufacturing processes of musical projects.
    In addition to my professional endeavors in sales and music, I am a
    self-taught specialist in computer and laptop repair, proficient with both
    Windows and Apple platforms. My deep-seated passion for technology has
    driven me to continuously expand my skill set, enabling me to build and
    optimize high-performance systems. Outside of my professional life, I am
    dedicated to playing the piano and maintaining an active lifestyle through
    regular exercise. These activities fuel my creativity and contribute to my
    overall well-being. Currently, I am transitioning my technical and creative
    expertise towards becoming a full stack developer, with a particular focus
    on backend development. I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and
    extensive experience in new and challenging projects within the tech
    industry. I am excited about the opportunity to collaborate with
    forward-thinking clients and employers who value innovation and excellence.
    Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your projects and help
    achieve your goals.
